# MandoBoutique
E-commerce app for light mandolin shopping 


What tech stack will you use for your final project?
 - The Tech Stack will be a Node Backend with a React front-end.

Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application? 
- The data will be scraped from a website. The focus of my application will be creating a great front-end experience for first-time mandolin buyers, but there will be some backend functionality as well. 


Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else? 
- This will be a web page, with a stretch goal of creating a mobile app.


What goal will your project be designed to achieve? 


- The goal of this project is to create a seamless experience for first-time mandolin buyers where they can filter to a great quality instrument that fits their preferences very easily. Users will be able to save items, review them, and add to cart. 


What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?
- People interested in mandolins and purchasing one for the first time or upgrading. People hoping to compare and contrast and find the best option. 


What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? 
- I will be scraping themandolinstore.com for data on mandolins, photos, audio, and features. 


In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information: 
  - What does your database schema look like?
    - Mandolins, Users, Collections (saved)
  - What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially important if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces notoriously messy data. 
    - Issues with inconsistent data from web scraping
  - Is there any sensitive information you need to secure? 
    - Userâ€™s password, possible payment information if that is enabled.
  - What functionality will your app include?
    - Filter and search mandolins, review mandolins, save to collections/cart, find mandolins based on user preference. 
  - What will the user flow look like? 
    - Sign up, set preferences, browse/search/filter mandolins, save them to cart, checkout. 
  - What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch goals?
    - Mobile App options
    - Actual payment options (payment API)
    - Login with alternate authentication
    - Play video/sound
