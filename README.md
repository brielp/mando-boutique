Link to Deployed Project: https://jazzy-suggestion.surge.sh/

Tech Stack:
 - The Tech Stack is a Node Backend with a React front-end.

- The data was scraped from a website. The focus of my application is creating a great front-end experience for first-time mandolin buyers.

- The goal of this project is to create an ecommerce website from scratch. 

- Database Schema
    - Mandolins, Users, Collections (saved)

- Functionality to add later: 
    - Filter and search mandolins, review mandolins, save to collections/cart, find mandolins based on user preference.
